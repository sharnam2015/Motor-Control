DC motor PID implementation on XEP MCU - As a part of MAC lab IIT Bombay - Lab Professor - Prof. Prassanna Gandhi

I implemented and tuned PID parameters, found out the gains for controlling the position of a DC Motor in real time. 
We used a FreeScale XEP 100 Microcontroller, a DC Motor with a built in optical digital encoder, A quadrature decoder, an H-Bridge and a power supply as the apparatus.
PWMs and interrupts are used to implement the PID logic in real time.
